## Setup

```terminal
yarn install
yarn rw dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/api/functions/*`.

## Development

Create a development database:

```terminal
yarn rw db up
```

This will read the schema definition in `api/prisma/schema.prisma` and generate a sqlite database in `api/prisma/dev.db`

If you've made changes to the schema run `yarn redwood db save` to generate a migration, and `yarn redwood db up` to apply the migration/ generate a new ORM client.
